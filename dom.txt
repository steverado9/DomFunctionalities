DOM- Document object model.
The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents.
The HTML DOM is a standard for interacting with HTML elements.

How to access/get/query elements in the DOM
1)document: This is used to access the whole elements in the dom.
2)document.getElementById: This is used to access elements in the Dom by their 'ID'.
3)document.getElementByClassName: accessing elements by their 'class' and this returns an HTML COLLECTION.
4)document.getElementByTagName: accessing elements by their 'tagName'. also returns an HTML COLLECTION.
5)document.querySelector: accessing a particular (one) element using it's css selector(id,class etc).
6)document.querySelectorAll: accessing several(Many) elements using it's css selector. returns a NODELIST
7)document.forms: returns an html collection of forms in the document. 
-you can use bracket notation [] to select the form you want or the ID.
HTML COLLECTIONS
This is a collection of html document element.
This is not an array but behaves as an array. 
-you can access elements using the square bracket[] notation.
-You can also loop through an html collection using the traditional for loop.
-Array.isArray(variable): This used to check if a variable is an array.
-Array.from(variable): converts an HTML Colletion to an array.
NODELIST
This is a collection of document nodeList eg elements, attributes, text.
Evertyhing in an html document is a node.
This is also not an array but looks like an array.
-you can access elements using the square bracket[] notation.
-You can also loop through an html collection using the traditional for loop.
-You can also use a forEach method on a nodeList.

CREATING ELEMENTS AND APPENDING IT TO THE DOM
document.createElement(): This is method is used to create element.
appendChild(): The appendChild() method appends a node (element) as the last child of an element.
textContent: return the text in an element.
innerHTML: returns the elements and text of an element. it can be used to append new elements.

ATTRIBUTES
getAttribute(): This is used to check/get attribute of an element.
setAttribute(): This is used to change the attribute of an element.
removeAttribute(): This is used to remove an attribute

DOM NODES
Evertyhing in the html document is a node.
Elements are a type of node.
Attributes are a type of node, comments, texts etc.
-nodeType: returns a number and the number is used to know the type of node.
-nodeName: returns the name of the element.
-cloneNode: creates a copy of a node and returns the copy.
Set the deep parameter to true if you also want to clone descendants (children).

Transvering the DOM(Moving in the dom)
-parentNode: returns the parent node of an element or node.
-parentElement: returns the parent element of an element.
-childNodes: returns the child nodes of an element or node.
-children: returns the children of an element or node.
-nextSibling: retuns the next sibling node of an element.
-nextElementSibling: returns the next Element Sibling of an element.
-previousSibling: returns the previous node of an element.
-previousElementSibling: returns the previous Element of an element.

Events
-addEventListener: This attaches an event handler to an event. the event handler is the function
-e: this is the event itself
-e.target: tells you the particular element you are targetting.
preventDefault: This cancels out the default event/behaviour.
parent.removechild(childName): This is used to delete in javascript.

Event Bubbling
Event bubbling directs an event to its target. It works like this:
When an element (like a button) is clicked, an event is directed to the element.
If an event handler is set for the element, the event handler is triggered.
Then the event "bubbles up" to the elements parent.
If an event handler is set for the parent, this event handler is triggered.
The event continues to bubble, until it reaches the top (the document element).

CheckBox Events
Change events are used for checkboxes, radio buttons because they are changing state.

DOM content loaded Event
The dom will finish loading before it loads any event
